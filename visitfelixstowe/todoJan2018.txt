right panel top - Yes the social media buttons with a link – just Facebook and Twitter would be good.

1.       You were going to send me the pantone colours for the orange, blue, yellow and green you have used, as I want to incorporate these into the headers.

2.       You were going to allow the WELCOME TO VISIT FELIXSTOWE header to be in lower case lettering.

3.       Have you reduced the box size of the link widget?

4.       Take out the VF logo at top of right hand column. I will create a social media link widget here.

5.       How do I get that right hand column to order as it currently doesn’t seem to allow me to put anything above the News Bit?
************************************************************************

1.       What’s On
The events are not showing at all so I can’t link to that area/or particular events. You are going to change the first page of What’s On to a Landing Page where I can create some box options, including one called Events Diary where will be put the full listing. *** done

2.       Need to add YouTube icon to social media lists at top and bottom. Please put it third after Twitter and Facebook. *** done

3.       Can those Image Links be ordered on the right hand side column by me? *** aye

4.       In the sections I have created in Things to Do and Visitor Information, I’m not getting the breadcrumb? *** fixed

5.       I see you have put on the Events bit in the right hand column. Can you select which events go there, for example I normally do a this weekend bit? It's using the first events it finds.... I can create widgets for news and events I think?

6.       The Suffolk Cloud logo at very bottom of each page has a broken link. *** fixed

7.       Is it possible to get a bit of our logo in the tab at very top instead of the ‘S’ which I take is Suffolk Biz? *** done

8.       Have you got copy on Cookies for this website?

9.       In Where to Stay, Shopping and Eat and Drink, in the right hand column there is the words NOIMAGES, how do I get rid of this? *** eliminated
